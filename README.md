# RECEIPTIFY - OCR-Based Expense Tracking Application

## Project Description
**RECEIPTIFY** is a Streamlit-based application designed to help users track and analyze their expenses effortlessly. Utilizing **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** technology, this application can scan shopping receipts, convert the extracted data into structured tables, and automatically generate **expense visualizations**.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Receipt Scanning**: Upload receipt images, and the app will extract the relevant data.
- **Data Visualization**: Display expenses based on store, category, and daily trends.
- **Export to Excel**: Download scanned data in Excel format.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Save expense data directly to Google Drive.
- **SLA Compliance Analysis**: Analyze expenses using statistical methods and AI.

## System Architecture
1. **Upload receipt image** to the application.
2. **OCR Processing** using an AI model to extract and structure the receipt data.
3. **Data Cleansing & Formatting** using Pandas.
4. **Data Visualization** with Plotly and Streamlit.
5. **Save Data** to Google Sheets or export as an Excel file.

## Installation & Running the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/receiptify.git
